About
----------
This is the web backend for @joshua-coppola's Ski-Trail-Ratings project, and all svg and csv files are from that repository. Jinja Templates are written by @craigmc08. This portion of the project creates the database tables, found in schema.sql, and passes the needed information to the front-end.
